## A pidgin for Lovecraftian cultists

A [pidgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin) is a language that evolves among two populations of people that cannot otherwise communicate with each other. **Lugso is a pidgin that emerged among cultists who regularly communicate with the Elder Gods.**

It is NOT a language-between-languages, however. Lugso is a language-between-worlds, because the Elder Gods not only do not speak in human tongues, but they do not _think_ in human concepts. Lugso represents not only eldritch _speech_, but eldritch _thought_ - or, as near as humans can manage, without giving themselves an internal hemorrhage. It is the mediation between human thought and the least sophisticated conceits of the unspeakable Old Ones. **It is a "meta-pidgin", connecting our fragile mental models with the biting winds of their reality.**

## Dedication

Lugso is dedicated to the man and woman showed me that not only is it possible to experience the indescribable truths undergirding all of creation (as Lovecraft feared that we could), but also that it is good and even beautiful to do so. It is dedicated to the two human beings who rescued me from a futile search for comprehension of the incomprehensible (as Lovecraft dared never imagine), and taught me instead to seek unity with Unity, and being united to Being. To the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary, on October 15th 2022 I dedicate and consecrate this language and all of its good effects, for eternity.

I also dedicate it to my wife, who I can only pray forgives me for spending so much time on this silly little thing.

# Phonology

## Phonemic Inventory

The initial idea was for Lugso's gimmick to be "only fricatives", but the wisdom of moderation won the day - it's now just *mostly* fricatives.

Great pains have been taken to preserve the feel and sense of the "big names" like Cthulhu, Yog-Sothoth, Shub-Niggurath, and so on - the conceit is as follows: Lovecraft *heard* these names spoken by real cultists *in Lugso*, and transcribed them into English as we know them. Lugso thus represents *the original language from which the famous monikers were derived.* It is my hope that phonetically, this has been done convincingly.

Consonants|bilabial|labiodental|dental|postalvoelar|alvoelar|alvoelar-lateral|velar|uvular|glottal
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
fricative|ɸβ|fv|θð|ʃʒ|sz||xɣ|χ
approximant||||j|ɻ|ɮ|
nasal|||||n||
stop|||||||ʔ

Vowels|front|central|back
|-|-|-
high|i||u
mid||ʌ/ə

ʌ/ə is the same phoneme, but ʌ is stressed and ə is unstressed.

### Importing names from English - rules for special sounds

As a general rule, the English sound, if it is a fricative, remains a fricative. If the English sound is a stop, it becomes a fricative at the same location. There are several exceptions to this, however.

English sound (ipa) | Lugso sound (ipa) | Lugso letter (latin)
|-|-
m|β|b
d|ð|d
t|θ|t*
θ ("th")|θx|tk
tʃ ("ch")|θʃ|t5
dʒ ("zh", as in _gara**ge**_)|zʒ|z3
l|ɮ|l
r|ɻ|r
k|x|k
g|ɣ|g
h|χ|h
u|u|u
i|i|i
a/o|ʌ|o

\* "t" is a dental stop, so its conversion should be _s_, but _s_ already exists in Lugso, so t becomes θ. Same with d and z - instead, d becomes ð.

## Phonotactics

In general: pronounce exactly as written, even if impossible. There are 2 exceptions:

1. Separate duplicate phonemes with glottal stops.
1. Separate adjacent vowels with glottal stops (even between words).

Brief pauses between words are encouraged.

**I've added a dot below the last letter of each morpheme (aka unit of meaning), to assist you in visually scanning them as you learn and read. These dots are ornamental and serve no other purpose.**

## Morphology

`(c)(c)(c)v(c)(c)`: Each syllable has a vowel, up to 3 onset consonants, and up to 2 coda consonants. Words will occasionally possess strings of 5 consonants, and may possess any number of syllables. Good luck!

Stress is always placed on the first syllable of each word. Duplicate phonemes are stressed as semi-syllables. Fortunately, most core words are only one or two syllables, although suffixes often increase that count.

# Syntax

## Word Order (Part I)

In English, we say, "I fly". In Lugso, the cultist says, "fly I". Verb comes before subject.

> so3 no

`fly 1SG`

> vux tlu

`swim beast`

_The/A beast swims._

## Word Order (Part II)

In English, we say, for example, but hopefully not too often, "You consume me." We know based on the fact that "You" comes before "consume" that it is you who are doing the consuming, and from the fact "me" comes after "consume" that it is I who am being consumed. In linguistic terms, you are the subject, consume is the verb, and I am the object. Order: S-V-O.

Lugso has word order V-O-S: a cultist says, "consume me you".

### Verb-Object-Subject

But how does he know what's the subject and what's the object? In English, we change "I" to "me", or "he" to "him" when the speaker is an object - _I_ hit **him**, but _he_ hits **me** - in Lugso, the cultist appends **-ir**, which performs the same transformation of any given noun. This is known as the _accusative case_.

### Accusative case

A noun obtains the accusative case if the verb is _being done to_ it.

> huf no'ir do

`consume 1SG-ACC 2SG`

_You consume me._

A noun also obtains accusative if it is the _destination of a movement._

> so3 do'ir tlu

`fly 2SG-ACC beast`

_The/A beast glides to you._

We will cover more **noun cases** in a future lesson.

## Suffix Order

Lugso leverages a great number of suffixes. The grammatical order is as follows:

### Noun suffixes

1. Root noun
2. Plural suffix
3. Case marker
4. Negation
5. Question suffix

### Verb suffixes

1. Root verb
2. Tense
3. Mood
4. Negation
5. Subordinating suffix
6. Question suffix
7. Relative or Conjunction

# Adjectives, Adverbs, Plurals

## Adjectives

In English, we say "red blood". In Lugso, we say "blood red". Adjectives _follow_ the noun that they modify.

> lug 3xig

`blood black`

_black blood..._

More than one adjective can be applied in this manner.

> it oldri5 gololol

`aeon weird infinite`

_infinite strange aeon..._

## Plurals

To pluralize something, affix **-d**.

> itd oldri5 gololol

`aeon-PL weird infinite`

_infinite strange aeons..._

Pluralization is how "we" and "y'all" and "they" are constructed:

Pronouns|1st Person|2nd Person|3rd Person
|-|-|-
Singular|no _I_|do _you_|un _it_
Plural|vo _we_|du _y'all_|sigf _they_

## Adverbs with uv

In English, we append -ly to an adjective, in order to form an adverb that describes the way in which a verb is performed. "The beast bites invisibly": "invisible" becomes "invisibly".

In Lugso, adverbs follow the verb that they modify. This is similar to English. However, unlike English, you cannot place an adverb before the verb it modifies: we think it's fine to say "the beast invisibly bites", but for your own safety, don't talk like that when speaking to a cultist.

> ih5 zuxuv tlu

`bite invisible-ADV.DER beast`

_The/A beast bites invisibly._

Any number of adverbs may be appended in this fashion.

> ih5 zuxuv 3xiguv golololuv tlu

`bite invisible-ADV.DER black-ADV.DER infinite-ADV.DER beast`

_The/A beast bites invisibly, blackly, infinitely._

# Possessives

## Possessive suffix

In English, when something belongs to someone, it is _someone's_ something. We add _'s_ to the possessing noun.

In Lugso, similarly, the cultist adds **-gu**.

> tu5o ungu

`priest 3SG-POSS`

_Its priest..._

> oxod dogu

`eye-PL 2SG-POSS`

_Your eyes..._

> hupz nogu

`human 1SG-POSS`

_My human..._

> xuy isvgu

`future heretic-POSS`

_The/A heretic's future..._

## Possessive vs. Genitive

Speakers of Latin will be confused at the inclusion of both the possessive suffix and the genitive case in Lugso. "What is the difference between "my blood" _the blood of my veins_, and "my blood" _the blood that I own (in that jar over there)_ ?"

In Lugso, Genitive is used to indicate origin and relation - hence **lugso** _of blood_. Possessive, by contrast, is strictly property/dominion/possession - **lugso gu5lidso sotdso** _of blood of gods of thoughts_ - not "thoughts' gods' blood's". Hence, the child that a mother gives birth to is both **yols rihso** and **yols rihgu** - his mother's child in origin, and (until he is an adult) his mother's child in dominion. 

# Copula

## Is, Am, Are

In English, we say "the star is a sacrifice", or "I am the secret." Using the verb _to be_ we describe equality between two things. This verb is called the _copula_.

In Lugso, the verb _to be_ does not exist. To describe equality, you would say "sacrifice star" or "secret I".

> lozyozof no

`secret 1SG`

_I am the secret._

> lihd fbu5d ungu

`star-PL servant-PL 3SG-POSS`

_The stars are its servants._

> frog gi5 nogu

`music master 1SG-POSS`

_Music is my master._

> xoz'zon zuyn-sot fiznli zin-zuyn-sot5ix hupz-gorngih'hzofgu

`obey-NMLZ.DER.act word important-SUPER vocabulary-LOC human--cult-POSS`

_The most important word in a cultist's vocabulary is "obedience"._

## This & That

The determinants, "this" and "that", are either adjectives that modify nouns, or nouns.

> hufoh ivol do

`consume-INT DET.DIST 2SG`

_Are you going to eat that?_

> vzur ivih pol-hupz nogu

`thing DET.PROX friend 1SG-POSS`

_This thing is my friend._

# Noun Cases, Negation

## Cases

What is a _noun case_? In a sense, it is the difference between "I" and "me". Unfortunately English does not have many exmaples of noun case. We typically use prepositions to communicate the things that noun cases communicate. "I go _to_ the store", versus "I go store`-ACC`" (accusative).

In Lugso, various aspects of language are communicated with noun case.

Case|Part of speech|IPA|Lugso|Notes
|-|-|-|-
ABL|N suffix| uɣ |ug|ablative case - about N, from location
ACC|N suffix| iɻ |ir|accusative case - to N, towards location
BEN|N suffix| ɮuɮ |lul|benefactive case - for the sake of N
COM|N suffix| nij |niy|comitative case "together with N, alongside N"
GEN|N suffix| sʌ |so|genitive case - of N, from N, N's (not possession - contrast POSS)
INS|N suffix| ifʔfə |if'fo|instrumental case - using N
LOC|N suffix| ʃix |5ix|locative case - at N, in N
NOM|N suffix| ∅ |∅|nominative case - the subject/actor/topic in a sentence
PROL|N suffix| ɸzuvʒ |pzuv3|prolative case (by way of N, via N, through N)
TEMP|N suffix| zxi |zxi|temporal case - during N
VOC|N suffix| u |u|vocative case - Hey N! O, N!

## Examples

Below, `NOM` is marked on the subjects of each sentence, but note that there _is no phoneme for marking the subject_; it is implicitly marked by an _un_-marked noun, and further denoted by the last noun phrase in the sentence - remember, Lugso is mostly Verb-Object-Subject. Nowhere else will `NOM` be marked.

Notice also that the `NEG` suffix ("not") is used in a few places.

### ACC accusative

> tug vgovzi pusir toht∅

`transgress can-NEG essence-ACC mind-NOM`

_The mind cannot penetrate transcendence!_

### VOC vocative

> lorgu gozigi

`larva-VOC move-NEG-IMP`

_Don't move, maggot!_

Notice anything strange? The word order is different. The vocative case - "hey you! listen to this thing I'm saying" - "pulls" the noun to the front of the sentence. This makes sense if you think about it. You want to say a person's name at the start of the speech, so they know to listen to the rest of it.

> 3figzobu zotso osgi no'ir

`open-NMLZ.DER.agent-VOC way-GEN transmit-IMP 1SG-ACC`

_Opener of the Way, deliver me!_

### LOC locative

> vsixi ovs5ix 5og'got∅

`emerge pit-LOC shoggoth-NOM`

_The shoggoth emerges in the pit._

> ugonogl5ix un

`home-LOC 3SG`

_It is at home._ (note the implicit copula)

### BEN benefactive

> hu5 nolul no'ir un∅

`love 1SG-BEN 1SG-ACC 3SG-NOM`

_It loves me, for me._

### ABL ablative

> zyuzh 3uzug lug∅

`descend fire-ABL blood-NOM`

_The blood falls from the fire._

### GEN genitive

> lug gu5lidso sotdso

`blood deity_intelligent-PL-GEN thought-PL-GEN`

_the blood of the thoughts of the gods..._

### INS instrumental

> pi5n gusxif'fo ipir snul'lso yug hupznu∅

`crush heel-INS head-ACC snake-GEN great human-F-NOM`

_The woman crushes the head of the great serpent with (her) heel._

Also used for things that are given:

> yurg gvifnlul gu5zi bgoxzobzonif'fo ubiso

`give body-BEN sapient-NEG lead-NMLZ.DER.agent-NMLZ.DER.act-INS organization_human-GEN`

_The unthinking body is given leadership of the organization._

### TEMP temporal

> fhtogi vgov itdzxi fhtog∅

`sleep can aeon-PL-TEMP death-NOM`

_In strange aeons, death may die._

### COM comitative

> zilx pusir lorgniy hupz∅

`exchange soul-ACC larva-COM human-NOM`

_The human exchanges souls with the maggot._

### PROL prolative

> lni 5xidpzuv3 yols-yols-lihd∅ oldri5

`revolve sky-PL-PROL child--child--star-PL-NOM strange`

_Strange moons circle through the skies._

## Negation

**-zi** negates any non-verb.

> oxo lu5zi unso

`eye liquid-NEG 3SG-GEN`

_Its illiquid eye..._

> ov5ozi

`patient-NEG`

_impatient..._

# Verb Moods

## Verb Moods

English|Part of speech|IPA|Lugso|Comment
|-|-|-|-
FORM|VB suffix| jʌ |yo|formal mood
IMP|VB suffix| ɣi |gi|imperative mood (a command)
IND|VB suffix| θʌj |toy|indicative mood - (optional except where ambiguous)
INT|VB suffix| ʌχ |oh|interrogative mood  - is ...? did X ...?
MOD|VB suffix| z |z|modal mood "must/have to"
PREC|VB suffix| xnuz |xnuz|precative mood (please ...)
PROH|VB suffix| jʌzβ |yozb|prohibitive mood (do not ...)
PROL|N suffix| ɸzuvʒ |pzuv3|prolative case (by way of N, via N, through N)

Verb moods indicate the way in which a certain action is performed. Think of, "Please would you do this?" versus "Do this!" versus "Are you doing this?" versus "You must do this."

### IMP imperative -gi

> gu5hgi -ir ivih xtulhulul

`surrender-IMP victim-ACC DET.PROX Cthulhu-BEN`

_Offer this victim to Cthulhu!_

IMP is the "command mood" used when giving orders.

### IND indicative* -toy
#### "There is/are"

Indicative is normally used to state existential clauses.

> toy it turso itid fhtogiso

`IND aeon birth-GEN aeon-CONJ.N sleep-GEN`

_[There is] A time to be born and a time to die._

While usually unnecessary to mark indicative mood (i.e. in almost all "basic" sentences), there are cases where it is important to distinguish _which_ verb is indicative, and which verb isn't.

#### Redundant indicative

> funtoy -ir ivih xtulhu

`allow-IND victim-ACC DET.PROX Cthulhu`

_[It is so that] Cthulhu accepts this victim._ 

#### Necessary indicative

The indicative is necessary when a _copula_ forms an ambiguous sentence.

> vtu3u pus'so noso toy fhtogn yud noso

`song-VOC soul-GEN 1SG-GEN IND dead voice 1SG-GEN`

_Song of my soul, my voice is dead._

#### WRONG

> vtu3u pus'so noso fhtogn yud noso

`song-VOC soul-GEN 1SG-GEN dead voice 1SG-GEN`

~~_O Song of my dead soul, [you are] my voice._~~

The fact that Lugso's copula is implicit means that the sentence is interpreted as (vtu3u pus'so noso fhtogn) (yud noso), since the adjective **fhtogn** follows the noun **pus'so noso**. Hence, the indicative "attaches" to the _implicit copula_, making its position explicit: (vtu3u pus'so noso) **toy** (fhtogn (yud noso)).

You'll notice indicative is almost always needed where the _Vocative Noun Case_ is used in combination with a copula. O English, when using you, we insert a comma to separate the addressee of the sentence; but Lugso does not have commas.

#### More about Vocative

The above examples are ambiguous because of the implicit copula combined with an addressee at the beginning of the utterance. This is standard practice for the vocative case, because just like in most languages, you want to say the name of the one you are addressing first. If you prefer, you can move the addressee to the end of the utterance to eliminate the ambiguity, since Lugso word order is often (but not always) malleable, but this does sound slightly weird.

> fhtogn yud noso vtu3u pus'so noso

`dead voice 1SG-GEN song-VOC soul-GEN 1SG-GEN`

_My voice is dead, O song of my soul._

### FORM formal: -yo

> xtulhu'u pinyo sup5ix blolgd doso

`Cthulhu-VOC flail-FORM eternity-LOC flagellum-PL 2SG-GEN`

_Thy tentacles writhe forever, O Cthulhu!_

### INT Interrogative: -oh

> fhtogioh xtulhu

`sleep-INT Cthulhu`

_Does Cthulhu sleep?_

### MOD modal: -z

> h3unbz xtulhu'ir vu

`gorge-MOD Cthulhu-ACC 1PL.INC`

_We must satisfy Cthulhu!_

### PREC precative: -xnuz

> xtulhu'u hufxnuz - ivih

`Cthulhu-VOC consume-PREC victim DET.PROX`

_O Cthulhu, (will you) please accept this victim!_

**-xnuz** signifies the utterance is a request.

### PROH prohibitive: -yozb

> zbostyozb zuyn-pus xtulhuso yug

`blaspheme-PROH name Cthulhu-GEN great`

_Do not blaspheme the name of Great Cthulhu!_

### PROL prolative: -pzuv3

> lni 5xidpzuv3 yols-yols-lihd oldri5

`revolve sky-PL-PROL child--child--star-PL beautiful`

_Strange moons circle through the skies._

# Prepositions

Lugso does not have prepositions; use these noun cases when such constructions are needed:

- By, via, through: PROL pzuv3
- Above, over: [WIP]
- Beneath, under: [WIP]
- In: [WIP]
- Out: GEN

# Verb Tense

Verb tense is the difference between _I was_, _I am_, and _I will be_, commonly called _past_, _present_, and _future_. 
Lugso marks verb tense with suffixes similar to moods.

In lugso, distinction is made between the **far** past and the generic past, and the generic future and the **far** future. Of course, what is far to human cultists is paltry moments to the outer gods, but there are times when the distinction is necessary to make from a mortal perspective.

### Tenses

#### FPRET far past tense

> zyuzhus xtulhu

`descend-FPRET Cthulhu`

_Cthulhu descended of old._

#### PRET preterite (simple past)

> fhtogiup xtulhu

`sleep-PRET Cthulhu`

_Cthulhu died/slept._

### PRS present tense

Unmarked.

#### FUT simple future

> huftu vu'ir xtulhu

`consume-FUT 1PL.INC-ACC Cthulhu`

_Cthulhu shall eat us._

#### FFUT far future

> fhtogil5i vgov itdzxi oldri5 fhtog yiy

`sleep-FFUT can aeon-PL-TEMP strange death EMPH`

_With strange aeons even death may die._

## Simple questions

### -5u: questions about things [noun suffix or standalone]

**-5u** is a noun suffix, and is used either _in place of_ a word to form a question, or _at the end of_ a word to make that word the subject of the question.

> huf hupz5u xtulhu

`consume human-Q Cthulhu`

_Which human is Cthulhu eating?_

> huf 5u xtulhu

`consume Q Cthulhu`

_What is Cthulhu eating?_

> 5u xtulhu

`Q Cthulhu`

_What is Cthulhu?_

Note here again the implicit copula.

> huf hupz xtulhu5u

`consume human Cthulhu-Q`

_Is **Cthulhu** eating a human (or is something else eating it)?_

### -oh: questions about actions and states [verb suffix - interrogative mood]

**-oh** is a verb suffix, and is used for questioning _whether_ the action is occurring.

This is different from -5u (which operates solely on nouns) in order to disambiguate between "`verb Q noun`?" and "`verb-Q noun`?" When INT and Q were the same - that is to say, when all cultists had was `Q`, and the question of _whether_ you were eating (`eat-Q you?`) was identical to the question of _what_ you were eating (`eat Q you?`), cultists never got anything done. So, in practice, `INT` emerged.

> fhtogioh xtulhu

`sleep-INT Cthulhu`

_Does Cthulhu sleep/die?_

> zodoh xtulhu

`dream-INT Cthulhu`

_Does Cthulhu dream?_

> hufoh hupz xtulhu

`consume-INT human Cthulhu`

_Is Cthulhu **eating** a human (or doing something else to it)?_

#### Auxiliary verbs

**oh** attaches to the auxiliary when forming a question.

> huf-yog vgovoh sru3ir ivol lugso do

`consume--knowledge can-INT referent-ACC DET.DIST blood-GEN 2SG`

_Can you learn what that blood portends?_

### "Wh-" words, using noun case + 5u

# Compounds

A compound noun is like "bus stop", "jelly bean", "doghouse", "cell phone", or "fire truck".

In Lugso, these words would be "stop bus", "bean jelly", "housedog", etc. The _actual thing_ comes first (known as the _head_), followed by its modifying nouns.

Since Lugso employs _noun cases_, it is important to note that _**only the final noun of a compound is "cased".**_

Adjectives may also form compounds, like in "serial killer" or "last rites".

Finally, _**you must hyphenate compound nouns in Lugso**_: "jelly-bean", "bus-stop", "dog-house".

## Noun compounds

> zyuzh rlohs-3uzug nziv5 lug

`descend fuel--fire-ABL upright blood`

_Blood falls from the upright tree._

Tree: "fire fuel". Grim.

### Examples: Variations on "water"

Below, in the English translations, the "head" of the compound is **bolded**. Remember the _head_ is the _actual thing_, and the other parts of the compound are _modifiers on that thing_. Remember also the English translations are backwards. the `glosses` have the correct Lugso word order.

> lug-5xi ugonogl nogu

`blood--sky home 1SG-POSS`

_Water is my home._

Water: sky-**blood**.

> rir yux5ix sfu-lug-5xi

`spread shore-LOC gas--blood--sky`

_Along the shore the clouds break._

Cloud: sky-blood **gas**.

> zyuzh tgihp-lug-5xi5ix lih-ugonogld

`descend bowl--blood--sky-LOC star--home-PL`

_The suns sink in the lake._

Lake: sky-blood **bowl**.

Verb compounds are something of a different animal, as their components are not always only verbs. In general, a verb compound is a group of words. The compound functions as a single word for the purposes of suffixes.

> huf-yu'up sru3ir yogo-sru3-zob fhtogior opnur

`learn-PRET truth-ACC cultist sleep-REL soon`

_The cultist, who was soon to die, learned the truth._

Cultist: _truth-knower_.

Learn: consume-knowledge.

"To see" is a verb that does a lot in English - it means to literally absorb photons with your eyes, but it also means to apprehend, to understand, and to find out. In Lugso, this is not the case: it strictly denotes photon absorption. "To see" in the sense of "to apprehend" is a different word (above). 

You can see that "see" is literally "sense-light": there are countless other senses that one can speak of in Lugso using the appropriate verb compounds (listed above). Note also that "light" is not just visual light in Lugso, it's any kind of photon from radio wave to gamma ray. The elder gods have a totalizing perspective.

> dlil3i sru3zi zotso noso

`apprehend-RET truth-NEG way-GEN 1SG-GEN`

_I have learned the error of my ways._

`see-PRET fall-SUB exact-ADV.DER presence-ACC 1SG-GEN head shed-PTCP.PAST.PASS follower--human 1SG-POSS`

_I saw the severed head of my dear friend fall squarely into my lap._

"To feel" also has many implications: humans have all of pressure sense, heat sense, and pain sense, and more. Lugso divides these. While heat is just light, pressure-sense and pain-sense are their own words (although it is rare that simple "pain" will not suffice).

Long, wide, and tall; short, narrow, and squat; Lugso's got them all. But cultists think of these words a little differently - they describe largeness or smallness in spatial dimensions - first, second, and third. 

Think of the sides of a box: Dimension 1 is box height; 2 is box width; 3 is box thickness. We might be tempted to say that 3 is "length", but a tall thing is also "long" ... it's complicated to explain. Lugso has a word for "long": "dimensionally great". It's not specific to a particular dimension.

> tlu-lu5 hi-ul

`beast--liquid small--two`

_narrow fish (two-small fish)_

> volx yug-ul

`void wide`

_wide chasm (two-large void)_

# Derivational Affixes

### Part-of-speech affixes

Oftentimes you wish to communicate something complex, and you almost have the right word, but not quite - you know _mortal_, but not _mortality_ - you know _death_, but not _deathly_... etc.

The act of turning one word into another part of speech is called _**derivation**_. Hence, "derivational affixes".

In English, _-ity_ turns an ADJ into a N. It's a "nounifier". English also has _-ness_, _-ism_, and so on for this purpose. Meanwhile, _-ly_ turns a N into an ADJ. It's an "adjectifier". See also _-y_, _-ish_, _-ful_...

Lugso has a special suffix for many types of derivation, and several additional affixes for more specific derivations.

#### verb -> noun

Lugso has three noun-ifying ("nominalizing") derivational affixes: one for the _act_ of verbing, one for _the one who verbs_, and one for _the one who is verbed_.

For nominalizing a non-verb, you can also use **-zon** - e.g. _blackness_ **3xigzon** (lit. "the act of black").

#### -n: non-adj -> adj

_death-ly_* **fhtogn**

_thought-ful_ **sotn**

_serpent-ine_ **snul'ln**

_servile (servant-ish)_ **fbu5n**

_unpriestlike_ **tu5onzi**

\* Note that English actually has two different _-ly_ words: one turns nouns into adjectives, like _deathly_, and the other turns adjectives into adverbs, like _hugely_ or _roughly_. **n** is only used for the _first_ kind of part-of-speech transformation.

#### -uv: non-adv -> adv

Adverbs modify verbs. I can run, or I can run _quickly_. 

Any noun or adjective can be converted into an adverb with **-uv**. 

_solid-ly_  **bin5uv**

_black-ly_ **3xiguv**

_parasitical-ly_ **pol-xuxuv***

\* Note that, unlike English, which must go from *parasite* to *parasit-ical* to *parasit-ical-ly*, lugso just goes from *pol-xux* to *pol-xuxuv* "parasitely".

### Comparative affixes - Augmentative and Diminutive

#### tux: "more ... than, -er"

_greater_ **yugtux**

_prettier, weirder_ **oldri5tux**

#### ix: "less ... than"

_less dead_ **fhtognix**

_less far_ **botutix**

####  in5: "-less", "without ..."

> lunin polszon'niy norso lugin5 pus noso

`wilt throb-NMLZ.DER.act-COM heart-GEN blood-PRV soul 1SG-GEN`

_My soul wilts at the throbbing of the bloodless heart._

You may also use these for non-adjectives to indicate nouns that are smaller or larger than usual, like Spanish "-ito".

_a little helper_ **yni5zobix** 

_a big fish_ **tlu-lu5tux**

_a friend_ - `follower-AUG` **poltux**

# Auxiliary Verbs

English|Part of Speech|IPA|Lugso|Comments
|-|-|-|-
can|AUX| vɣʌv |vgov|
hunger|VB| χuʃ |hu5|also "love", "want to"
begin|VB| ʒɣuɻ |3gur|
dream|VB| zʌð |zod|also "wish to"
last|ADJ| uʒən |u3on|

An _auxiliary verb_ is like English "can", "might". In English they are effectively intransitive verbs that modify an infinitive. Other intransitives that work similarly are "want", "wish".

In Lugso, to **wish** to do something, you _dream_ for it. To **want** to do something, you _hunger_ for it. Since Lugso is as always head-initial, the structure is [main verb] [auxiliary verb]. (The difference is partly of degree and partly of kind - dreaming is velleity: intellectual and often milder; hungering is sub-cognitive, visceral, strong.) _To begin to_ do something uses _begin_ as English does.

> pur hu5 ipdir gu5lidlul

`harvest hunger head-PL-ACC god-PL-BEN`

_I desire/want/yearn to harvest heads for the gods._

> buz vgov ivihir no

`finish can DET.PROX-ACC 1SG` 

_I can do this._ 

> fhtogi 3gur u3onuv no

`die begin final-ADV.DER 1SG`

_Finally, I begin to die._

> huf yog vgov lugir gu5lidso sotdso no

`consume knowledge can blood-ACC deity_intelligent-PL-GEN thought-PL-GEN 1SG`

_I can learn the blood of the thoughts of the gods._

### Questions

**5u** attaches to the auxiliary when forming a question.

> huf yogi5 vgovoh sru3ir yiy lugso ivol do

`consume knowledge-CONJ.but can-INT referent-ACC EMPH blood-GEN DET.DIST 2SG`

_But can you learn what that blood truly means?_

# Relative Clauses, Conjunctions

English|Part of speech|IPA|Lugso|Comment
|-|-|-|-
CONJ.and|VB suffix| uβ |ub|and' for verbs
CONJ.but|VB suffix| iʃ |i5|
CONJ.N|N suffix| ið |id|and' for nouns: noun AND noun did xyz (also called 'enclitic')
REL|VB suffix| ʌɻ |or|introduces relative clause

## Relative Clauses

"the X that Yed / the A that B Ced"

> tlupol nofor no

`beast-follower possess-REL 1SG`

_the dog that I own..._

In English, "that" does many things, and one of those things is _introduce relative clauses_. A _relative clause_ describes some noun in greater detail.

_the house **that** had ten mice in each room_: "had ten mice..." modifies _house_.

In Lugso, the relative-clause-introducer is another verb suffix. It follows any other suffixes on the verb, for example, future tense:

> hpi5d yogso vuntu'or no

`space-PL knowledge-GEN penetrate-FUT-REL 1SG`

_the spaces of knowledge that I will penetrate..._

> dlilgi sru3ir u3or vgovzi oxo

`apprehend-IMP truth-ACC sense-REL can-NEG eye`

_Behold the truth that no eye can perceive!_

## Conjunctions

### Joining sentences

"A, **but** B"; "C, **and** D, **and** E"

Lugso uses commas in the same way as English. Note that A, B, C, D, and E are _complete sentences_.

> 3o3 oldri5 lni'ub 5xidpzuv3 yols-yols-lihd oldri5

`night beautiful revolve-CONJ.and sky-PL-PROL child--child--star-PL beautiful`

_Strange is the night, and strange moons circle through the skies._

Remember that the copula ("to be") is implicit, so the clause ", but Y is Z" is introduced by only **i5**:

> huf-yu zod lusot gu5lidso i5 hi lodi toht noso

`learn dream system-thought god-PL-GEN CONJ.but small feeble mind 1SG-GEN`

_I wish to learn the language of gods, but my mind is small and feeble._

Notice also that "my mind IS feeble" (**hi lodi toht noso**) is written `small feeble mind 1SG-GEN`, whereas "my small, feeble mind" (which is _not_ a complete sentence) is formed **toht hi lodi noso** `mind small feeble 1SG-GEN`.

> gogi loxir u3zi'or gu5lid

`go-IMP place-ACC sense-NEG-REL god-PL`

_Go to the place the gods look not._

> fhtognzi ivol rxi'or vgov supuv fhtogiub vgov itdzxi oldri5 fhtog yiy

`dead-NEG DET.DIST abide-REL can eternity-ADV.DER sleep-CONJ.and can aeon-PL-TEMP strange death EMPH`

_That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons even death may die._

### Joining nouns

> tlud nogu blolgdid noso

`beast-PL 1SG-POSS tentacle-PL-CONJ.N 1SG-GEN`

_my beasts and my tentacles_

> if3i bul-gu5liir yogo-sru3-zob gu5liid gu5ixzonid

`organize pact-ACC cultist deity_intelligent-CONJ.N uninitiate-CONJ.N`

_The cultist, the god, and the unititiate drew up a pact._

# Subordinate Clauses

A _subordinate clause_ joins two complete sentences. The sub-clause marker attaches to the verb of the second sentence, which in all cases will be its first word.

## Normal sub-clauses

> rils no roxrig no

`seek 1SG find-SUB.reason 1SG`

_I seek_ + `SUB.reason` + _I find_ = _I seek in order that I find._

> hit no gu5hu3g un

`strike 1SG surrender-SUB.purpose 3SG`

_I strike because he surrenders._

> sog ubidug hun vo zunxrig rvod 5ifso hunzi vo

`depart organization_human-PL-ABL mortal 1PL.EX unite-SUB.reason web time-GEN mortal-NEG 1PL.EX`

_We depart from our mortal families in order to cleave to an undying lineage._

## With copula in the second sentence

The sub-clause marker appears bare, as with verb moods.

> yurgup gvifnlul gu5zi bgoxzobzonif'fo ubifuso upglin fxo3n xutzi pold ungu

`give-PRET body-BEN sapient-NEG lead-NMLZ.DER.agent-NMLZ.DER.act-INS organization_human-earth-GEN PRET-SUB.concession false hidden-NEG follower-PL 3SG-POSS`

_The unthinking body was given leadership of the organization_ + `SUB.concession` + _his followers were plainly false_ =

_The meat-puppet was given leadership of the nation, even though his support was obviously fabricated._

# Participles

English|Part of Speech|IPA|Lugso|Comments
|-|-|-|-
PTCP.NEG|VB suffix| zjʌ |zyo|x sing-PTCP.NEG -> the x not sung
PTCP.PAST.ACT|VB suffix| βjʌ |byo|x sing-PTCP.PAST.ACT -> the x that sung
PTCP.PAST.PASS|VB suffix| ðjʌ |dyo|x sing-PTCP.PAST.PASS -> the x that was sung
hunger|VB| χuʃ |hu5|also "love", "want to"

Participles are like adjectives. A participle derives from a verb to create a description of a noun. 

### verb-byo: "the ... that verbed" 

This participle indicates that the subject actively peformed the action.

> hot't fupzuv3 tluli lobyo

`dig earth-PROL deity_bestial speak-PTCP.PAST.ACT`

_The animal-god, who spoke, digs through earth._

### verb-dyo: "the ... that was verbed"

This participle indicates that some action was performed to the subject.

> opy 3gur fu hot'tdyo

`decompose begin earth dig-PTCP.PAST.PASS`

_The earth that was dug begins to decompose._

### verb-zyo: "the ... that has not verbed" or "the unverbed ..."

This participle indicates that some action has not been performed by the subject. As a participle that English lacks, it may take some getting used to. It is approximately equal in meaning to **dyozi** `PTCP.PAST.PASS-NEG`, and that is how it is usually translated.

> yols hi fhtogizyo

`child small sleep-PTCP.NEG`

_The small child **who has not slept**_ (lit. "the unslept child")

> do'u fhtogigi hu5zyo

`2SG-VOC sleep-IMP love-PTCP.NEG`

_You! Die unloved._

# Cassilda's Song

## Original

Along the shore the cloud waves break,

The twin suns sink beneath the lake,

The shadows lengthen

In Carcosa.

Strange is the night where black stars rise,

And strange moons circle through the skies

But stranger still is

Lost Carcosa.

Songs that the Hyades shall sing,

Where flap the tatters of the King,

Must die unheard in

Dim Carcosa.

Song of my soul, my voice is dead;

Die thou, unsung, as tears unshed

Shall dry and die in

Lost Carcosa.

#### Discussion

- heaven

`distant-SUPER` ... 'the highest'. See also 'holy' meaning 'separated'

- evil

Cultists do not know good versus evil; they only know reality versus imagination and lies. Their perspective is entirely material. The 'order' of the Cthulhuverse is beyond human comprehension, and inherently hostile to human life, _but it is nevertheless an ordering of things_, and to know the truth is inherently good (as we would say).

Morality in the real world comes from God, but God is not real in the Cthulhuverse (although it's logically impossible that God not be real, we are just pretending for the sake of the story). The "creator god" is Azathoth, who is ironically a creative form of chaos itself. But creation flows from him, order and negentropy flows from him, the universe and all that is in it flow from him, and in this sense he is the highest order of the world.

- amen

In the old Hebrew, 'amen' means 'so be it', hence "may it be realized".

### Ave Maria

Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

Suscipe, Domine, universam meam libertatem. Accipe memoriam, intellectum, atque voluntatem omnem. Quidquid habeo vel possideo mihi largitus es; id Tibi totum restituo, ac Tuae prorsus voluntati trado gubernandum. Amorem Tui solum cum gratia Tua mihi dones, et dives sum satis, nec aliud quidquam ultra posco. Amen.

#### English

Receive, O Lord, all my liberty. 
Take my memory, understanding and entire will. 
Whatever I have or possess, You have given me; 
I restore it all to You, 
and surrender it wholly to be governed by Your will. 
Give me love, for You alone along with your grace,
and I am rich enough, and ask for nothing more.

## Ecclesiastes 3:1-9

Two translations are provided below for comparison.
### Douay

1. All things have their season, and in their times all things pass under heaven. 
1. A time to be born and a time to die. A time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted. 
1. A time to kill, and a time to heal. A time to destroy, and a time to build. 
1. A time to weep, and a time to laugh. A time to mourn, and a time to dance. 
1. A time to scatter stones, and a time to gather. A time to embrace, and a time to be far from embraces.
1. A time to get, and a time to lose. A time to keep, and a time to cast away. 
1. A time to rend, and a time to sew. A time to keep silence, and a time to speak. 
1. A time of love, and a time of hatred. A time of war, and a time of peace. 
1. What hath man more of his labour?

### Knox

1. Everything must be done by turns; no activity, here beneath the heavens, but has its allotted time for beginning and coming to an end.
1. Men are born only to die, plant trees only to displant them.
1. Now we take life, now we save it; now we are destroying, now building.
1. Weep first, then laugh, mourn we and dance;
1. the stones we have scattered we must bring together anew; court we first and then shun the embrace.
1. To-day’s gain, tomorrow’s loss; what once we treasured, soon thrown away;
1. the garment rent, the garment mended; silence kept, and silence ended;
1. love alternating with hatred, war with peace.
1. For all this toiling of his, how is man the richer?
