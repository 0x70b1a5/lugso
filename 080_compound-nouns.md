A compound noun is like "bus stop", "jelly bean", "doghouse", "cell phone", or "fire truck".

In Lugso, these words would be "stop bus", "bean jelly", "housedog", etc. The _actual thing_ comes first (known as the _head_), followed by its modifying nouns.

Since Lugso employs _noun cases_, it is important to note that _**only the final noun of a compound is "cased".**_

Adjectives may also form compounds, like in "serial killer" or "last rites".

Finally, _**you must hyphenate compound nouns in Lugso**_: "jelly-bean", "bus-stop", "dog-house".

## Noun compounds

**zyuzh Zuz-rlohs-nzivSvsug lug.**

`descend fuel-fire-upright-ABL blood`

_Blood falls from the tree._

Tree: "upright fire fuel". Grim.

Note that although "upright" is an adjective, it is treated as part of the compound for purposes of the case affix. This would not be the case if a non-semantic adjective were to modify "tree": **Zuz-rlohs-nzivS liy**, the secret tree - **Zuz-rlohs-nzivSvsug liy**, _from_ the secret tree.

### Examples: Variations on "water"

Below, in the English translations, the "head" of the compound is **bolded**. Remember the _head_ is the _actual thing_, and the other parts of the compound are _modifiers on that thing_. Remember also the English translations are backwards. the `glosses` have the correct Lugso word order.

**lug-Stki ugonogl kurgu.**

`blood-sky home 1SG-POSS`

_Water is my home._

Water: sky-**blood**.

**zkiyS yukSitk ogS-lug-Stkiib.**

`dissipate shore-LOC wave-PL gas-blood-sky`

_Along the shore the clouds break._

Cloud: sky-blood **gas**.

**zyuzh tkgihp-lug-StkiSitk lih-ugonoglib.**

`descend bowl-blood-sky-LOC star-home-PL`

_The suns sink in the lake._

Lake: sky-blood **bowl**.
