### Importing names from English - rules for special sounds

As a general rule, the English sound, if it is a fricative, remains a fricative. If the English sound is a stop, it becomes a fricative at the same location. There are several exceptions to this, however.

n|ð|n
d|z|z
t|θ|t (would normally be 's')
θ|θx|tk
tʃ|θʃ|tS

## Phonotactics

No phonotactic changes. Pronounce exactly as written, even if impossible.

Duplicated phonemes (e.g. the second "b" in pobb `/ɸʌββ/` "mortal") are stressed, for comprehension. `/'ɸʌβ'β/`

## Morphology

`(c)(c)v(c)(c)`: Each syllable has a vowel, up to 2 onset consonants, and up to 2 coda consonants. Words will occasionally possess strings of 4 consonants. Good luck!
