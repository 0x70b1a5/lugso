Lugso is a language for eldritch cultists. Its full name is incapable of being written, since it is infinite - **lugso guSliibso sotso lugso guSliibso sotso lugso guSliibso sotso...** _of the blood of the gods of the thoughts of the blood of the gods of the thoughts..._ - but "lugso" (of the blood) will suffice for our purposes, since it is written almost exclusively _in_ blood.

A [pidgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin) is a language that evolves among two populations of people that cannot otherwise communicate with each other. Lugso is a pidgin that emerged among cultists who attempted to communicate with the Elder Gods. It is NOT a language-between-languages, however. Lugso is a language-between-worlds, because the Elder Gods not only do not speak in human tongues, but they do not _think_ in human concepts. Lugso represents not only eldritch _speech_, but eldritch _thought_ - or, as near as humans can manage, without giving themselves an internal hemorrhage.
