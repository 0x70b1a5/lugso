Participles are like adjectives. A participle derives from a verb to create a description of a noun. 

### verb-byọ: "the ... that verbed" 

This participle indicates that the subject actively peformed the action.

<span class='spoken btnOnly'> <button class='speak' type='button' data-ipa='χʌθʔθ fuɸzuvʒ θɮuɮi ɮʌβjə'>🔈</button>  </span> <strong>hot'ṭ fụpzuv3̣ tlụlị lọbyọ</strong>

`dig earth-PROL deity_bestial speak-PTCP.PAST.ACT`

_The animal-god, who spoke, digs through earth._

### verb-dyọ: "the ... that was verbed"

This participle indicates that some action was performed to the subject.

<span class='spoken btnOnly'> <button class='speak' type='button' data-ipa='ʌɸj ʒɣuɻ fu χʌθʔθðjə'>🔈</button>  </span> <strong>opỵ 3guṛ fụ hot'ṭdyọ</strong>

`decompose begin earth dig-PTCP.PAST.PASS`

_The earth that was dug begins to decompose._

### verb-zyọ: "the ... that has not verbed" or "the unverbed ..."

This participle indicates that some action has not been performed by the subject. As a participle that English lacks, it may take some getting used to. It is approximately equal in meaning to **dyọzị** `PTCP.PAST.PASS-NEG`, and that is how it is usually translated.

<span class='spoken btnOnly'> <button class='speak' type='button' data-ipa='jʌɮs χi fχθʌɣizjə'>🔈</button>  </span> <strong>yolṣ hị fhtog̣ịzyọ</strong>

`child small sleep-PTCP.NEG`

_The small child **who has not slept**_ (lit. "the unslept child")
