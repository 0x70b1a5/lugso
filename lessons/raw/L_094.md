Participles are like adjectives. A participle derives from a verb to create a description of a noun. 

### verb-byo: "the ... that verbed" 

This participle indicates that the subject actively peformed the action.

**hot't fupzuv3 tluli lobyo**

`dig earth-PROL deity_bestial speak-PTCP.PAST.ACT`

_The animal-god, who spoke, digs through earth._

### verb-dyo: "the ... that was verbed"

This participle indicates that some action was performed to the subject.

**opy 3gur fu hot'tdyo**

`decompose begin earth dig-PTCP.PAST.PASS`

_The earth that was dug begins to decompose._

### verb-zi5: "the ... that has not verbed" or "the unverbed ..."

This participle indicates that some action has not been performed by the subject. As a participle that English lacks, it may take some getting used to. It is approximately equal in meaning to **dyozi** `PTCP.PAST.PASS-NEG`, and that is how it is usually translated.

**yols hi fhtognzi5**

`child small sleep-PTCP.NEG`

_The small child **who has not slept**_ (lit. "the unslept child")

**fhtogngi do'ut hu5zi5**
