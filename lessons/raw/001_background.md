A [pidgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin) is a language that evolves among two populations of people that cannot otherwise communicate with each other. **Lugso is a pidgin that emerged among cultists who regularly communicate with the Elder Gods.**

It is NOT a language-between-languages, however. Lugso is a language-between-worlds, because the Elder Gods not only do not speak in human tongues, but they do not _think_ in human concepts. Lugso represents not only eldritch _speech_, but eldritch _thought_ - or, as near as humans can manage, without giving themselves an internal hemorrhage. It is the mediation between human thought and the least sophisticated conceits of the unspeakable Old Ones. **It is a "meta-pidgin", connecting our fragile mental models with the biting winds of their reality.**
