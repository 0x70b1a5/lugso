A _subordinate clause_ joins two complete sentences. The sub-clause marker attaches to the verb of the second sentence, which in all cases will be its first word.

## Normal sub-clauses

**rils kur NoWordFound:"find"rig kur**

`seek 1SG find-SUB.reason 1SG`

_I seek_ + `SUB.reason` + _I find_ = _I seek in order that I find._

**hit kur gu5hu3g un**

`strike 1SG surrender-SUB.purpose 3SG`

_I strike because he surrenders._

## With copula in the second sentence

The sub-clause marker appears bare, as with verb moods.

**yurguln gvifnluli gu5zit bgoklzoblzotiffo NoWordFound:"organization.human"fuso ulnglin 5o5l kuttzit polib ungu**

`give-PRET body-BEN sentient-NEG lead-NMLZ.DER.agent-NMLZ.DER.act-INS organization.human-earth-GEN PRET-SUB.concession false hidden-NEG follower-PL 3SG-POSS`

_The unthinking body was given leadership of the organization_ + `SUB.concession` + _his followers were plainly false_ =

_The meat-puppet was given leadership of the nation, even though his support was obviously fabricated._
