A compound noun is like "bus stop", "jelly bean", "doghouse", "cell phone", or "fire truck".

In Lugso, these words would be "stop bus", "bean jelly", "housedog", etc. The _actual thing_ comes first (known as the _head_), followed by its modifying nouns.

Since Lugso employs _noun cases_, it is important to note that _**only the final noun of a compound is "cased".**_

Adjectives may also form compounds, like in "serial killer" or "last rites".

Finally, _**you must hyphenate compound nouns in Lugso**_: "jelly-bean", "bus-stop", "dog-house".
