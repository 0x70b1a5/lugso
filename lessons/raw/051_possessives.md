## Possessive suffix

In English, when something belongs to someone, it is _someone's_ something. We add _'s_ to the possessing noun.

In Lugso, similarly, the cultist adds **-gu**.

## Possessive vs. Genitive

Speakers of Latin will be confused at the inclusion of both the possessive suffix and the genitive case in Lugso. "What is the difference between _my blood_ and _the blood of me_?"

In Lugso, Genitive is used to indicate origin and relation - hence **lugso** _of blood_. Possessive, by contrast, is strictly property/dominion/possession - **lugso guSliibso sotibso** _of blood of gods of thoughts_ - not "thoughts' gods' blood's".
