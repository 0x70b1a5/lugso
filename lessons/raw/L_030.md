## Word Order (Part I)

In English, we say, "I fly". In Lugso, the cultist says, "fly I". Verb comes before subject.

<span class='spoken btnOnly'> <button class='speak' type='button' data-ipa='sʌʒ nʌ'>🔈</button>  </span> <strong>so3̣ nọ</strong>

`fly 1SG`

---

<span class='spoken btnOnly'> <button class='speak' type='button' data-ipa='vux θɮu'>🔈</button>  </span> <strong>vux̣ tlụ</strong>

`swim beast`

_The/A beast swims._

## Word Order (Part II)

In English, we say, for example, but hopefully not too often, "You consume me." We know based on the fact that "You" comes before "consume" that it is you who are doing the consuming, and from the fact "me" comes after "consume" that it is I who am being consumed. In linguistic terms, you are the subject, consume is the verb, and I am the object. Order: S-V-O.

Lugso has word order V-O-S: a cultist says, "consume me you".

### Verb-Object-Subject

But how does he know what's the subject and what's the object? In English, we change "I" to "me", or "he" to "him" when the speaker is an object - _I_ hit **him**, but _he_ hits **me** - in Lugso, the cultist appends **-iṛ**, which performs the same transformation of any given noun. This is known as the _accusative case_.

### Accusative case

A noun obtains the accusative case if the verb is _being done to_ it.

<span class='spoken btnOnly'> <button class='speak' type='button' data-ipa='χuf nʌʔiɻ ðʌ'>🔈</button>  </span> <strong>huf̣ nọ'iṛ dọ</strong>

`consume 1SG-ACC 2SG`

_You consume me._

---

A noun also obtains accusative if it is the _destination of a movement._

<span class='spoken btnOnly'> <button class='speak' type='button' data-ipa='sʌʒ ðʌʔiɻ θɮu'>🔈</button>  </span> <strong>so3̣ dọ'iṛ tlụ</strong>

`fly 2SG-ACC beast`

_The/A beast glides to you._

We will cover more **noun cases** in a future lesson.
