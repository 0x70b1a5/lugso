## Relative Clauses

"the X that Yed / the A that B Ced"

**tlupol nofor kur**

`beast-follower possess-REL 1SG`

_the dog that I own..._

In English, "that" does many things, and one of those things is _introduce relative clauses_. A _relative clause_ describes some noun in greater detail.

_the house **that** had ten mice in each room_: "had ten mice..." modifies _house_.

In Lugso, the relative-clause-introducer is another verb suffix. It follows any other suffixes on the verb, for example, future tense:

**hpi5 yogso vuntkuor kur**

`space knowledge-GEN penetrate-FUT-REL 1SG`

_the spaces of knowledge that I will penetrate..._

**<span style="color:red">NoWordFound:"see.mental"</span>gi <span style="color:red">NoWordFound:"truth"</span>ir <span style="color:red">NoWordFound:"see.material"</span>or vgovzit oko**

`see.mental-IMP truth-ACC see.material-REL can-NEG eye`

_Behold the truth that no eye can perceive!_

## Conjunctions

"A, **but** B"; "C, **and** D, **and** E"

Lugso uses commas in the same way as English. Note that A, B, C, D, and E are _complete sentences_.

**3o3 olnri5 lniin 5tkiibpzuv3 yols-yols-lihib olnri5**

`night beautiful revolve-CONJ.and sky-PL-PROL child--child--star-PL beautiful`

_Strange is the night, and strange moons circle through the skies._

Remember that the copula ("to be") is invisible, so the clause ", but Y is Z" is introduced by only **i5**:

**huf-yu zontk lusot gu5liibso i5 hi <span style="color:red">NoWordFound:"feeble"</span> toht kurso**

`learn dream system-thought god-PL-GEN CONJ.but small feeble mind 1SG-GEN`

_I wish to learn the language of gods, but my mind is small and feeble._

Notice also that "my mind IS feeble" (**hi <span style="color:red">NoWordFound:"feeble"</span> toht kurso**) is written `small feeble mind 1SG-GEN`, whereas "my small, feeble mind" (which is _not_ a complete sentence) is formed **toht hi <span style="color:red">NoWordFound:"feeble"</span> kurso** `mind small feeble 1SG-GEN`.
