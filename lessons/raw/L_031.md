## Latin alphabet writing system

**IPA**|ɸ|β|f|v|θ|ð|ʃ|ʒ|s|z|ɮ|x|ɣ|χ|j|ɻ|i|u|ʌ|n
**Latin**|p|b|f|v|t|n|5|3|s|z|l|k|g|h|y|r|i|u|o|n

## Tentacular Abjad

Inverse of normal abjad - vowels are main body of writing; consonants are diacritics.

### Vowels

Vowels form the main body of each word. Words are represented by one connected group of tentacles.

ipa|latin|tentaculary
|-|-
i|i|a tentacle sweeping upward
u|u|a tentacle sweeping downward
ʌ|o|a flat tentacle

Vowels are the thickest tentacles in a word. Loops in vowels are most often ornamental.

### Consonants

Consonants are tentacles that branch off of their root vowels.

A consonant on the left (u/i) or top (o) of its vowel comes prior to the vowel (the _onset_ of the syllable). A consonant on the right (u/i) or bottom (o) of its vowel comes after the vowel (the _coda_ of the syllable).

![consonants on vowels](/assets/buf%20siy%20rog.png)

    1: a plain tentacle branching off the vowel.
    2: a tentacle that splits into two tentacles.
    L: a tentacle terminating in a loop (no trailing tip).
    X': a self-looping tentacle.
    XY: a tentacle composed of an X followed by a Y.

### Examples

The syllables have been hyphenated to assist you in seeing the breakdown.

<span class='spoken btnOnly'> <button class='speak' type='button' data-ipa='ɮuɣsə ɣuʃɮiðsə sʌθsə'>🔈</button>  </span> <strong>lugso gu5lidso sotso</strong>

As you can see, loops in vowels can be ornamental, but loops in consonants are not.

Additionally, in compound nouns, loops serve as hyphens.

Where there are multiple consonants in the onset or the coda of a syllable, they are evaluated left-right, top-bottom.

![tbufl hsiyk zrogs](/assets/tbufl%20hsiyk%20zrogs.png)

This example is nonsense (for now), and a bit cramped, but you can see how on u or i, the top consonant precedes the bottom, and on the o, the left precedes the right.

### Mandatory: Loops for disambiguating vowel clusters

Sometimes lone "o" appears in words, for example the name "huoxin" hu+o+xin.

To disambiguate the bare "o", use two loops in the vowel line. below: huoxin vs. huxin.

The small, straight lines here are a shorthand for drafting.

### Optional: Capping consonants

When a word begins or ends with one consonant, the consonant can cap the vowel rather than branching off it, **unless that consonant is _b_ or _p_**.

#### Style 1: Uncapped

<span class='spoken btnOnly'> <button class='speak' type='button' data-ipa='ɣʌɻn χuɸznusə χʒunβðjə'>🔈</button>  </span> <strong>gorn hupznuso h3unbdyo</strong>

`organization_natural human-female-GEN gorge-PTCP.PAST.PASS`

_Order of the Bloated Woman_ (from _Masks of Nyarlathotep_, Shanghai chapter.)

Note the ornamental loops in each word. Technically, it is ambiguous with **ogorno hupsoniso hZunbokub**, but thankfully, that means nothing. Be advised that you may wish to double-check whether your ornamental loops create unintended - or intended - double meanings.

#### Style 2: Capped

<span class='spoken btnOnly'> <button class='speak' type='button' data-ipa='jʌɮsiɻ'>🔈</button>  </span> <strong>yolsir</strong>

`child-ACC`

### Optional: Vowel stacking

In longer words, sometimes you observe many subsequent o's. In these cases, you may "stack" the horizontal segments for aesthetic purposes:

![Child of Nyarlathotep](/assets/yols-nyorlothotopso1.png)

<span class='spoken btnOnly'> <button class='speak' type='button' data-ipa='jʌɮs njʌɻɮəsχəθəɸsə'>🔈</button>  </span> <strong>yols nyorloshotopso</strong>

`child nyarlathotep-GEN`

_child of Nyarlathotep_. (not Nyarlathotep's child - subtle difference!)

If your long word with many o's also has u's or i's, make sure they are vertical, to avoid confusion:

[ IMAGE PENDING REDRAW ]

<span class='spoken btnOnly'> <button class='speak' type='button' data-ipa='ɣʌɮəɮəɮzənɸzuvʒ'>🔈</button>  </span> <strong>golololzonpzuv3</strong>

`infinite-NMLZ.DER-PROL`

Note the lack of a loop on the last syllable of **golololzonpzuv3** - a loop would make the bottom horizontal read as **lzofoib**.
