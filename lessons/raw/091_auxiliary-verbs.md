An _auxiliary verb_ is like English "can", "might". In English they are effectively intransitive verbs that modify an infinitive. Other intransitives that work similarly are "want", "wish".

In Lugso, to **wish** to do something, you _dream_ for it. To **want** to do something, you _hunger_ for it. Since Lugso is as always head-initial, the structure is [main verb] [auxiliary verb]. (The difference is partly of degree and partly of kind - dreaming is more intellectual and less intense than hungering, which is visceral and strong.)

**fok hhu5 ipibir NoWordFound:"god"ibluli**

`harvest hunger head-PL-ACC god-PL-BEN`

_I desire/want/yearn to harvest heads for the gods._

### Questions

**oh** attaches to the auxiliary when forming a question.
