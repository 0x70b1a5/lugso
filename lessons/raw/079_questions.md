## Simple questions

### -5u: questions about things [noun suffix or standalone]

**-5u** is a noun suffix, and is used either _in place of_ a word to form a question, or _at the end of_ a word to make that word the subject of the question.

**huf hupz5u ktkulhu**

`consume human-Q Cthulhu`

_Which human is Cthulhu eating?_

---

**huf 5u ktkulhu**

`consume Q Cthulhu`

_What is Cthulhu eating?_

---

**5u ktkulhu**

`Q Cthulhu`

_What is Cthulhu?_

Note here again the invisible copula.

---

**huf hupz ktkulhu5u**

`consume human Cthulhu-Q`

_Is **Cthulhu** eating a human (or is something else eating it)?_

### -oh: questions about actions and states [verb suffix - interrogative mood]

**-oh** is a verb suffix, and is used for questioning _whether_ the action is occurring.

This is different from -5u (which operates solely on nouns) in order to disambiguate between "`verb Q noun`?" and "`verb-Q noun`?" When INT and Q were the same - that is to say, when all cultists had was `Q`, and the question of _whether_ you were eating (`eat-Q you?`) was identical to the question of _what_ you were eating (`eat Q you?`), cultists never got anything done. So, in practice, `INT` emerged.

**fhtognoh ktkulhu**

`sleep-INT Cthulhu`

_Does Cthulhu sleep/die?_

---

**zodtkoh ktkulhu**

`dream-INT Cthulhu`

_Does Cthulhu dream?_

---

**hufoh hupz ktkulhu**

`consume-INT human Cthulhu`

_Is Cthulhu **eating** a human (or doing something else to it)?_

#### Auxiliary verbs

**oh** attaches to the auxiliary when forming a question.

**huf-yog vgovoh sru3ir ivol lugso do**

`consume--knowledge can-INT referent-ACC DET.DIST blood-GEN 2SG`

_Can you learn what that blood portends?_
