## Phonemic Inventory

The initial idea was for Lugso's gimmick to be "only fricatives", but the wisdom of moderation won the day - it's now just *mostly* fricatives.

Great pains have been taken to preserve the feel and sense of the "big names" like Cthulhu, Yog-Sothoth, Shub-Niggurath, and so on - the conceit is as follows: Lovecraft *heard* these names spoken by real cultists *in Lugso*, and transcribed them into English as we know them. Lugso thus represents *the original language from which the famous monikers were derived.* It is my hope that phonetically, this has been done convincingly.

### Importing names from English - rules for special sounds

As a general rule, the English sound, if it is a fricative, remains a fricative. If the English sound is a stop, it becomes a fricative at the same location. There are several exceptions to this, however.

English sound (ipa) | Lugso sound (ipa) | Lugso letter (latin)
|-|-
m|Î²|b
d|Ã°|d
t|Î¸|t*
Î¸ ("th")|Î¸x|tk
tÊƒ ("ch")|Î¸Êƒ|t5
dÊ’ ("zh", as in _gara**ge**_)|zÊ’|z3
l|É®|l
r|É»|r
k|x|k
g|É£|g
h|Ï‡|h

\* "t" is a dental stop, so its conversion should be _s_, but _s_ already exists in Lugso, so t becomes Î¸. Same with d and z - instead, d becomes Ã°.

## Phonotactics

In general: pronounce exactly as written, even if impossible.

Separate duplicate letters with glottal stops. (e.g. hun /<span class='spoken'> <button class='speak' type='button' data-ipa='Ï‡un'>ðŸ”ˆ</button> <span class='ipa'>Ï‡un</span> </span>/ "mortal")

Separate adjacent vowels with glottal stops (even between letters). (e.g. bu'i /<span class='spoken'> <button class='speak' type='button' data-ipa='Î²uÊ”i'>ðŸ”ˆ</button> <span class='ipa'>Î²uÊ”i</span> </span>/ "human organization")

Brief pauses between words are encouraged.

## Morphology

`(c)(c)(c)v(c)(c)`: Each syllable has a vowel, up to 3 onset consonants, and up to 2 coda consonants. Words will occasionally possess strings of 5 consonants, and may possess any number of syllables. Good luck!

Stress is always placed on the first syllable of each word. Duplicate phonemes are stressed as semi-syllables. Fortunately, most core words are only one or two syllables, although suffixes often increase that count.
