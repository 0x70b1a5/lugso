## Adjectives

In English, we say "red blood". In Lugso, we say "blood red". Adjectives _follow_ the noun that they modify.

**lug Zkig...**

`blood black`

_black blood..._

---

More than one adjective can be applied in this manner.

**itg olnriS gololol...**

`aeon weird infinite`

_infinite strange aeon..._

## Plurals

To pluralize something, affix **-ib**.

**itgib olnriS gololol...**

`aeon-PL weird infinite`

_infinite strange aeons..._

Pluralization is how "we" and "y'all" and "they" are constructed:

Pronouns|1st Person|2nd Person|3rd Person
|-|-|-
Singular|kur _I_|luk _you_|un _it_
Plural|kurib _we_|lukib _y'all_|unib _they_

## Adverbs

In English, we append -ly to an adjective, in order to form an adverb that describes the way in which a verb is performed. "The beast bites invisibly": "invisible" becomes "invisibly".

In Lugso, adverbs follow the verb that they modify. This is similar to English. However, unlike English, you cannot place an adverb before the verb it modifies: we think it's fine to say "the beast invisibly bites", but for your own safety, don't talk like that when speaking to a cultist.

**ihS zutknSuv tlu.**

`bite invisible-ADV.DER beast`

_The/A beast bites invisibly._

---

Any number of adverbs may be appended in this fashion.

**ihS zutknSuv zkignSuv golololnSuv tlu.**

`bite invisible-ADV.DER black-ADV.DER infinite-ADV.DER beast`

_The/A beast bites invisibly, blackly, infinitely._
