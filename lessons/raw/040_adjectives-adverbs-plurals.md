## Adjectives

In English, we say "red blood". In Lugso, we say "blood red". Adjectives _follow_ the noun that they modify.

**lug 3kig**

`blood black`

_black blood..._

---

More than one adjective can be applied in this manner.

**itg olnri5 gololol**

`aeon weird infinite`

_infinite strange aeon..._

## Plurals

To pluralize something, affix **-ib**.

**itgib olnri5 gololol**

`aeon-PL weird infinite`

_infinite strange aeons..._

Pluralization is how "we" and "y'all" and "they" are constructed:

Pronouns|1st Person|2nd Person|3rd Person
|-|-|-
Singular|kur _I_|luk _you_|un _it_
Plural|vo _we_|tu _y'all_|sigf _they_

## Adverbs with n5uv

In English, we append -ly to an adjective, in order to form an adverb that describes the way in which a verb is performed. "The beast bites invisibly": "invisible" becomes "invisibly".

In Lugso, adverbs follow the verb that they modify. This is similar to English. However, unlike English, you cannot place an adverb before the verb it modifies: we think it's fine to say "the beast invisibly bites", but for your own safety, don't talk like that when speaking to a cultist.

**ih5 zutkn5uv tlu**

`bite invisible-ADV.DER beast`

_The/A beast bites invisibly._

---

Any number of adverbs may be appended in this fashion.

**ih5 zutkn5uv 3kign5uv golololn5uv tlu**

`bite invisible-ADV.DER black-ADV.DER infinite-ADV.DER beast`

_The/A beast bites invisibly, blackly, infinitely._
