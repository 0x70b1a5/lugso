## Simple questions

### -${Q}$: questions about things [noun suffix or standalone]

**-${Q}$** is a noun suffix, and is used either _in place of_ a word to form a question, or _at the end of_ a word to make that word the subject of the question.

${g: consume human-Q Cthulhu}$

_Which human is Cthulhu eating?_

---

${g: consume Q Cthulhu}$

_What is Cthulhu eating?_

---

${g: Q Cthulhu}$

_What is Cthulhu?_

Note here again the invisible copula.

---

${g: consume human Cthulhu-Q}$

_Is **Cthulhu** eating a human (or is something else eating it)?_

### -${INT}$: questions about actions and states [verb suffix - interrogative mood]

**-${INT}$** is a verb suffix, and is used for questioning _whether_ the action is occurring.

This is different from -${Q}$ (which operates solely on nouns) in order to disambiguate between "`verb Q noun`?" and "`verb-Q noun`?" When INT and Q were the same - that is to say, when all cultists had was `Q`, and the question of _whether_ you were eating (`eat-Q you?`) was identical to the question of _what_ you were eating (`eat Q you?`), cultists never got anything done. So, in practice, `INT` emerged.

${g: sleep-INT Cthulhu}$

_Does Cthulhu sleep/die?_

---

${g: dream-INT Cthulhu}$

_Does Cthulhu dream?_

---

${g: consume-INT human Cthulhu}$

_Is Cthulhu **eating** a human (or doing something else to it)?_

#### Auxiliary verbs

**${INT}$** attaches to the auxiliary when forming a question.

${g: consume--knowledge can-INT referent-ACC DET.DIST blood-GEN 2SG}$

_Can you learn what that blood portends?_

### "Wh-" words, using noun case + ${Q}$

#### "where": Locative + Q

${g: tremble LOC-Q voice-PL certain-NEG}$

_Where do the uncertain voices tremble?_

#### "how": Instrumental + Q

${g: dessicate INS-Q heretic-PL hidden 2SG}$

_How did you dehydrate the hidden heretics?_

#### "whence/from where": Ablative + Q

${g: come ABL-Q sacrifice--beast DET.PROX}$

_Where did this unwilling xsacrifice come from?_

#### "why": Prolative + Q

${g: mercurial PROL-Q child}$

_Why is the child mercurial?_

#### "when": Temporal + Q

${g: change TEMP-Q child}$

_When does the child change?_

#### "who": Reflexive + ${Q}$ (literally "whatself")

${g: crush priest-ACC REFL-Q}$

_Who (which 'self') crushed the priest?_
