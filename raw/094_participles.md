Participles are like adjectives. A participle derives from a verb to create a description of a noun. 

### verb-${PTCP.PAST.ACT}$: "the ... that verbed" 

This participle indicates that the subject actively peformed the action.

${g: dig earth-PROL deity_bestial speak-PTCP.PAST.ACT}$

_The animal-god, who spoke, digs through earth._

### verb-${PTCP.PAST.PASS}$: "the ... that was verbed"

This participle indicates that some action was performed to the subject.

${g: decompose begin earth dig-PTCP.PAST.PASS}$

_The earth that was dug begins to decompose._

### verb-${PTCP.NEG}$: "the ... that has not verbed" or "the unverbed ..."

This participle indicates that some action has not been performed by the subject. As a participle that English lacks, it may take some getting used to. It is approximately equal in meaning to **${PTCP.PAST.PASS-NEG}$** `PTCP.PAST.PASS-NEG`, and that is how it is usually translated.

${g: child small sleep-PTCP.NEG}$

_The small child **who has not slept**_ (lit. "the unslept child")

${g: sleep-IMP 2SG-VOC love-PTCP.NEG}$

_You! Die unloved._
