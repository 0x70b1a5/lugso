## Cases

What is a _noun case_? In a sense, it is the difference between "I" and "me". Unfortunately English does not have many exmaples of noun case. We typically use prepositions to communicate the things that noun cases communicate. "I go _to_ the store", versus "I go store`-ACC`" (accusative).

In Lugso, various aspects of language are communicated with noun case.

## Examples

Below, `NOM` is marked on the subjects of each sentence, but note that there _is no phoneme for marking the subject_; it is implicitly marked by an _un_-marked noun, and further denoted by the last noun phrase in the sentence - remember, Lugso is mostly Verb-Object-Subject. Nowhere else will `NOM` be marked.

Notice also that the `NEG` suffix ("not") is used in a few places.

### ACC accusative

${g: transgress can-NEG essence-ACC mind-NOM}$

_The mind cannot penetrate transcendence!_

### VOC vocative

${g: larva-VOC move-NEG-IMP}$

_Don't move, maggot!_

Notice anything strange? The word order is different. The vocative case - "hey you! listen to this thing I'm saying" - "pulls" the noun to the front of the sentence. This makes sense if you think about it. You want to say a person's name at the start of the speech, so they know to listen to the rest of it.
