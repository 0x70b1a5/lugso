## Cases

What is a _noun case_? In a sense, it is the difference between "I" and "me". Unfortunately English does not have many exmaples of noun case. We typically use prepositions to communicate the things that noun cases communicate. "I go _to_ the store", versus "I go store`-ACC`" (accusative).

In Lugso, various aspects of language are communicated with noun case.

## Examples

Below, `NOM` is marked on the subjects of each sentence, but note that there _is no phoneme for marking the subject_; it is implicitly marked by an _un_-marked noun, and further denoted by the last noun phrase in the sentence - remember, Lugso is mostly Verb-Object-Subject. Nowhere else will `NOM` be marked.

Notice also that the `NEG` suffix ("not") is used in a few places.

### ACC accusative

Marks the direct object of a verb (the thing being acted upon), or the destination of movement.

${g: transgress can-NEG essence-ACC mind-NOM}$

_The mind cannot penetrate transcendence!_

---

${g: consume flesh-ACC beast-NOM}$

_The beast consumes flesh._

---

${g: fly star-ACC bird-NOM}$

_The bird flies to the star._

### VOC vocative

Marks direct address: "O N!", "Hey N!". Pulls the noun to the front of the sentence.

${g: larva-VOC move-NEG-IMP}$

_Don't move, maggot!_

Notice anything strange? The word order is different. The vocative case - "hey you! listen to this thing I'm saying" - "pulls" the noun to the front of the sentence. This makes sense if you think about it. You want to say a person's name at the start of the speech, so they know to listen to the rest of it.

${g: open-NMLZ.DER.agent-VOC way-GEN transmit-IMP 1SG-ACC}$

_Opener of the Way, deliver me!_

---

${g: master-VOC hear-IMP pray-NMLZ.DER.act-ACC 1SG-GEN}$

### BEN benefactive

Marks the beneficiary of an action: "for the sake of N", "for N's benefit". Contrast with MAL (malefactive), which marks adverse effect.

### GEN genitive

Marks relation or origin: "of N", "from N", "pertaining to N". Expresses that one noun is related to or derived from another.

**GEN vs POSS**: Genitive marks _relation_ or _origin_ ("the blood _of_ the god" - the blood came from or pertains to the god). Possessive marks _ownership_ ("the god's book" - the god owns the book). Compare: "child of Nyarlathotep" (origin/lineage, GEN) vs. "Nyarlathotep's child" (the child belongs to Nyarlathotep, POSS).
