A compound noun is like "bus stop", "jelly bean", "doghouse", "cell phone", or "fire truck".

In Lugso, these words would be "stop bus", "bean jelly", "housedog", etc. The _actual thing_ comes first (known as the _head_), followed by its modifying nouns.

Since Lugso employs _noun cases_, it is important to note that _**only the final noun of a compound is "cased".**_

Adjectives may also form compounds, like in "serial killer" or "last rites".

Finally, _**you must hyphenate compound nouns in Lugso**_: "jelly-bean", "bus-stop", "dog-house".

## Noun compounds

${g: descend fuel--fire-ABL upright blood}$

_Blood falls from the upright tree._

Tree: "fire fuel". Grim.

### Examples: Variations on "water"

Below, in the English translations, the "head" of the compound is **bolded**. Remember the _head_ is the _actual thing_, and the other parts of the compound are _modifiers on that thing_. Remember also the English translations are backwards. the `glosses` have the correct Lugso word order.

${g: blood--sky home 1SG-POSS}$

_Water is my home._

Water: sky-**blood**.

${g: spread shore-LOC gas--blood--sky}$

_Along the shore the clouds break._

Cloud: sky-blood **gas**.

Verb compounds are something of a different animal, as their components are not always only verbs. In general, a verb compound is a group of words. The compound functions as a single word for the purposes of suffixes.

${g: learn-PRET truth-ACC cultist sleep-REL soon}$

_The cultist, who was soon to die, learned the truth._

Cultist: _truth-knower_.

Learn: consume-knowledge.

"To see" is a verb that does a lot in English - it means to literally absorb photons with your eyes, but it also means to apprehend, to understand, and to find out. In Lugso, this is not the case: it strictly denotes photon absorption. "To see" in the sense of "to apprehend" is a different word (above). 

You can see that "see" is literally "sense-light": there are countless other senses that one can speak of in Lugso using the appropriate verb compounds (listed above). Note also that "light" is not just visual light in Lugso, it's any kind of photon from radio wave to gamma ray. The elder gods have a totalizing perspective.

${g: apprehend-RET truth-NEG way-GEN 1SG-GEN}$

_I have learned the error of my ways._

${g: see-PRET fall-SUB exact-ADV.DER presence-ACC 1SG-GEN head shed-PTCP.PAST.PASS follower--human 1SG-POSS}$

_I saw the severed head of my dear friend fall squarely into my lap._

"To feel" also has many implications: humans have all of pressure sense, heat sense, and pain sense, and more. Lugso divides these. While heat is just light, pressure-sense and pain-sense are their own words (although it is rare that simple "pain" will not suffice).

${r: narrow}$

${r: thin}$
${r: tall}$
${r: wide}$
${r: thick}$
${r: long}$

Long, wide, and tall; short, narrow, and squat; Lugso's got them all. But cultists think of these words a little differently - they describe largeness or smallness in spatial dimensions - first, second, and third. 

Think of the sides of a box: Dimension 1 is box height; 2 is box width; 3 is box thickness. We might be tempted to say that 3 is "length", but a tall thing is also "long" ... it's complicated to explain. Lugso has a word for "long": "dimensionally great". It's not specific to a particular dimension.

${g: beast--liquid small--two}$

_narrow fish (two-small fish)_

${g: void wide}$

_wide chasm (two-large void)_
