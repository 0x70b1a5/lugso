A compound noun is like "bus stop", "jelly bean", "doghouse", "cell phone", or "fire truck".

In Lugso, these words would be "stop bus", "bean jelly", "housedog", etc. The _actual thing_ comes first (known as the _head_), followed by its modifying nouns.

Since Lugso employs _noun cases_, it is important to note that _**only the final noun of a compound is "cased".**_

Adjectives may also form compounds, like in "serial killer" or "last rites".

Finally, _**you must hyphenate compound nouns in Lugso**_: "jelly-bean", "bus-stop", "dog-house".

${g: descend fuel--fire-ABL upright blood}$

Tree: "fire fuel". Grim.

### Examples: Variations on "water"

${r: learn}$

${g: learn-PRET truth-ACC cultist sleep-REL soon}$

_The cultist, who was soon to die, learned the truth._

Cultist: _truth-knower_.

Learn: consume-knowledge.

${r: narrow}$
${r: short}$
${r: thin}$
${r: tall}$
${r: wide}$
${r: thick}$
${r: long}$

Long, wide, and tall; short, narrow, and squat; Lugso's got them all. But cultists think of these words a little differently - they describe largeness or smallness in spatial dimensions - first, second, and third. 

"Long" isn't really committal to a particular dimension, so it's just "great in one dimension".

${g: beast--liquid small--two}$

_narrow fish (two-small fish)_

${g: void wide}$

_wide chasm (two-large void)_
