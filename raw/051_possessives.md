## Possessive suffix

In English, when something belongs to someone, it is _someone's_ something. We add _'s_ to the possessing noun.

In Lugso, similarly, the cultist adds **-${POSS}$**.

${g: priest 3SG-POSS}$

_Its priest..._

${g: eye-PL 2SG-POSS}$

_Your eyes..._

---

${g: human 1SG-POSS}$

_My human..._

${g: future heretic-POSS}$

_The/A heretic's future..._

## Possessive vs. Genitive

Speakers of Latin will be confused at the inclusion of both the possessive suffix and the genitive case in Lugso. "What is the difference between _the blood that I own_ and _the blood of my veins_?"

In Lugso, Genitive is used to indicate origin and relation - hence **${blood-GEN}$** _of blood_. Possessive, by contrast, is strictly property/dominion/possession - **${blood-GEN deity_intelligent-PL-GEN thought-PL-GEN}$** _of blood of gods of thoughts_ - not "thoughts' gods' blood's". Hence, the child that a mother gives birth to is both **${child mother-GEN}$** and **${child mother-POSS}$** - his mother's child in origin, and (until he is an adult) his mother's child in dominion.
