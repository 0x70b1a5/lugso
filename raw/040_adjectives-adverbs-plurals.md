## Lesson Vocab

English|Part of speech|IPA|Lugso|Comment
|-|-|-|-
${r: ADV.DER}$
${r: aeon}$
${r: beautiful, weird, strange}$
${r: bite}$
${r: black}$
${r: blood}$
${r: infinite}$
${r: invisible}$
${r: 3SG}$
${r: PL}$

## Adjectives

In English, we say "red blood". In Lugso, we say "blood red". Adjectives _follow_ the noun that they modify.

${g: blood black}$

_black blood..._

---

More than one adjective can be applied in this manner.

${g: aeon weird infinite}$

_infinite strange aeon..._

## Plurals

To pluralize something, affix **-ib**.

${g: aeon-PL weird infinite}$

_infinite strange aeons..._

---

Pluralization is how "we" and "y'all" and "they" are constructed:

Pronouns|1st Person|2nd Person|3rd Person
|-|-|-
Singular|${1SG}$ _I_|${2SG}$ _you_|${3SG}$ _it_
Plural|${1PL}$ _we_|${2PL}$ _y'all_|${3PL}$ _they_

## Adverbs

In English, we append -ly to an adjective, in order to form an adverb that describes the way in which a verb is performed. "The beast bites invisibly": "invisible" becomes "invisibly".

In Lugso, adverbs follow the verb that they modify. This is similar to English. However, unlike English, you cannot place an adverb before the verb it modifies: we think it's fine to say "the beast invisibly bites", but for your own safety, don't talk like that when speaking to a cultist.

${g: bite invisible-ADV.DER beast}$

_The/A beast bites invisibly._

---

Any number of adverbs may be appended in this fashion.

${g: bite invisible-ADV.DER black-ADV.DER infinite-ADV.DER beast}$

_The/A beast bites invisibly, blackly, infinitely._
