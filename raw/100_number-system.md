Lugso uses a prime-based number system concerned only with the natural numbers. Decimals, imaginaries, and higher mathematics are expressed in terms we cannot comprehend.

Not invented by me, Lugso uses the [Xenotation](http://hyperstition.abstractdynamics.org/archives/003538.html) system of representing numbers with dots and circles. A dot signifies 2. A circle signifies "the Nth prime", where N is the number inside it. Two adjacent numbers are multiplied.

(.)|the 2nd prime (3)
..|2*2 (4)
((.))|the 3rd prime (5)
.(.)|two times the 2nd prime (2*3 = 6)
(..)|the 4th prime (7)
...|2\*2\*2 (8)
(.)(.)|3*3 (9)
.((.))|two times the 3rd prime (10)

When drawing rather than typing, inscribe them like so:
