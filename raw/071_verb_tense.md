Verb tense is the difference between _I was_, _I am_, and _I will be_, commonly called _past_, _present_, and _future_. 
Lugso marks verb tense with suffixes similar to moods.

In lugso, distinction is made between the **far** past and the generic past, and the generic future and the **far** future. Of course, what is far to human cultists is paltry moments to the outer gods, but there are times when the distinction is necessary to make from a mortal perspective.
