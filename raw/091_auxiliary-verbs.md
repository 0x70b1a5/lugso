${r: can}$
${r: hunger}$
${r: dream}$

An _auxiliary verb_ is like English "can", "might". In English they are effectively intransitive verbs that modify an infinitive. Other intransitives that work similarly are "want", "wish".

In Lugso, to **wish** to do something, you _dream_ for it. To **want** to do something, you _hunger_ for it. Since Lugso is as always head-initial, the structure is [main verb] [auxiliary verb]. (The difference is partly of degree and partly of kind - dreaming is more intellectual and less intense than hungering, which is visceral and strong.)
