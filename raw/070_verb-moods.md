## Verb Moods

${r: FORM}$
${r: IMP}$
${r: IND}$
${r: INT}$
${r: MOD}$
${r: PREC}$
${r: PROH}$
${r: PROL}$

Verb moods indicate the way in which a certain action is performed. Think of, "Please would you do this?" versus "Do this!" versus "Are you doing this?" versus "You must do this."

### IMP imperative -${IMP}$

${g: surrender-IMP victim-ACC DET.PROX Cthulhu-BEN}$

_Offer this victim to Cthulhu!_

IMP is the "command mood" used when giving orders.

### IND indicative* -${IND}$

While usually unnecessary to mark indicative mood, there are cases where it is important to distinguish _which_ verb is indicative, and which verb isn't.

#### Redundant indicative

${g: allow-IND victim-ACC DET.PROX Cthulhu}$

_Cthulhu accepts this victim._

#### Necessary indicative

The indicative is necessary when a _copula_ forms an ambiguous sentence.

${g: song-VOC soul-GEN 1SG-GEN IND dead voice 1SG-GEN}$

_Song of my soul, my voice is dead._

#### WRONG

${g: song-VOC soul-GEN 1SG-GEN dead voice 1SG-GEN}$

~~_O Song of my dead soul, [you are] my voice._~~

The fact that Lugso's copula is implicit means that the sentence is interpreted as (${song-VOC soul-GEN 1SG-GEN dead}$) (${voice 1SG-GEN}$), since the adjective **${dead}$** follows the noun **${soul-GEN 1SG-GEN}$**. Hence, the indicative "attaches" to the _implicit copula_, making its position explicit: (${song-VOC soul-GEN 1SG-GEN}$) **${IND}$** (${dead}$ (${voice 1SG-GEN}$)).

You'll notice indicative is almost always needed where the _Vocative Noun Case_ is used in combination with a copula. O English, when using you, we insert a comma to separate the addressee of the sentence; but Lugso does not have commas.

#### More about Vocative

The above examples are ambiguous because of the implicit copula combined with an addressee at the beginning of the utterance. If you prefer, you can move the addressee to the end of the utterance to eliminate the ambiguity, since Lugso word order is often (but not always) malleable.

${g: dead voice 1SG-GEN song-VOC soul-GEN 1SG-GEN}$

_My voice is dead, O song of my soul._

### FORM formal: -${FORM}$

${g: Cthulhu-VOC flail-FORM eternity-LOC flagellum-PL 2SG-GEN}$

_Thy tentacles writhe forever, O Cthulhu!_

### INT Interrogative: -${INT}$

${g: sleep-INT Cthulhu}$

_Does Cthulhu sleep?_

### MOD modal: -${MOD}$

${g: gorge-MOD Cthulhu-ACC 1PL.INC}$

_We must satisfy Cthulhu!_

### PREC precative: -${PREC}$

${g: Cthulhu-VOC consume-PREC victim DET.PROX}$

_O Cthulhu, (will you) please accept this victim!_

**-${PREC}$** signifies the utterance is a request.

### PROH prohibitive: -${PROH}$

${g: blaspheme-PROH name Cthulhu-GEN great}$

_Do not blaspheme the name of Great Cthulhu!_

### PROL prolative: -${PROL}$

${g: revolve sky-PL-PROL child--child--star-PL beautiful}$

_Strange moons circle through the skies._
