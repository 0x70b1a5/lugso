## Relative Clauses

"the X that Yed / the A that B Ced"

${g: beast-follower possess-REL 1SG}$

_the dog that I own..._

In English, "that" does many things, and one of those things is _introduce relative clauses_. A _relative clause_ describes some noun in greater detail.

_the house **that** had ten mice in each room_: "had ten mice..." modifies _house_.

In Lugso, the relative-clause-introducer is another verb suffix. It follows any other suffixes on the verb, for example, future tense:

${g: space knowledge-GEN penetrate-FUT-REL 1SG}$

_the spaces of knowledge that I will penetrate..._

---

${g: see_mental-IMP truth-ACC sense-REL can-NEG eye}$

_Behold the truth that no eye can perceive!_

## Conjunctions

"A, **but** B"; "C, **and** D, **and** E"

Lugso uses commas in the same way as English. Note that A, B, C, D, and E are _complete sentences_.

${g: night beautiful revolve-CONJ.and sky-PL-PROL child--child--star-PL beautiful}$

_Strange is the night, and strange moons circle through the skies._

Remember that the copula ("to be") is invisible, so the clause ", but Y is Z" is introduced by only **${CONJ.but}$**:

${g: learn dream system-thought god-PL-GEN CONJ.but small feeble mind 1SG-GEN}$

_I wish to learn the language of gods, but my mind is small and feeble._

Notice also that "my mind IS feeble" (**${small feeble mind 1SG-GEN}$**) is written `small feeble mind 1SG-GEN`, whereas "my small, feeble mind" (which is _not_ a complete sentence) is formed **${mind small feeble 1SG-GEN}$** `mind small feeble 1SG-GEN`.

${g: go-IMP place-ACC see-NEG-REL god-PL}$

_Go to the place the gods look not._

${g: dead-NEG DET.DIST abide-REL can eternity-ADV.DER sleep-CONJ.and can aeon-PL-TEMP beautiful/strange death EMPH}$

_That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons even death may die._
