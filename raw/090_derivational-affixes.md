### Part-of-speech affixes

Oftentimes you wish to communicate something complex, and you almost have the right word, but not quite - you know _mortal_, but not _mortality_ - you know _death_, but not _deathly_... etc.

The act of turning one word into another part of speech is called _**derivation**_. Hence, "derivational affixes".

In English, _-ity_ turns an ADJ into a N. It's a "nounifier". English also has _-ness_, _-ism_, and so on for this purpose. Meanwhile, _-ly_ turns a N into an ADJ. It's an "adjectifier". See also _-y_, _-ish_, _-ful_...

Lugso has a special suffix for many types of derivation, and several additional affixes for more specific derivations.

#### verb -> noun

Lugso has three noun-ifying ("nominalizing") derivational affixes: one for the _act_ of verbing, one for _the one who verbs_, and one for _the one who is verbed_.

|-|-|-|-
${r: NMLZ.DER.act}$
${r: NMLZ.DER.agent}$
${r: NMLZ.DER.patient}$

${g: mortal-NMLZ.DER.act}$

_mortal-ness, the act of being mortal, mortality..._

---

${g: birth-NMLZ.DER.patient}$

_that which is born, the birthed..._

---

${g: open-NMLZ.DER.agent way-GEN}$

_Opener of the Way..._

---

${g: rise revolve-NMLZ.DER.act}$

_Revolution rises..._

---

${g: satisfy-NMLZ.DER.act 1SG-POSS}$

_Satisfaction is mine._

#### non-verb -> noun

For nominalizing a non-verb, you can also use **-${NMLZ.DER.act}$** - e.g. _blackness_ **${black-NMLZ.DER.act}$** (lit. "the act of black").

#### non-adj -> adj

_death-ly_* **${death-ADJ.DER}$**

_thought-ful_ **${thought-ADJ.DER}$**

_serpent-ine_ **${snake-ADJ.DER}$**

_servile (servant-ish)_ **${servant-ADJ.DER}$**

_unpriestlike_ **${priest-ADJ.DER-NEG}$**

\* Note that English actually has two different _-ly_ words: one turns nouns into adjectives, like _deathly_, and the other turns adjectives into adverbs, like _hugely_ or _roughly_. **fbuyb** is only used for the _first_ kind of part-of-speech transformation.

#### non-adv -> adv

_solid-ly_  **${solid-ADV.DER}$**

_black-ly_ **${black-ADV.DER}$**

_parasitical-ly_ **${follower--food-ADV.DER}$***

\* Note that, unlike English, which must go from *parasite* to *parasit-ical* to *parasit-ical-ly*, lugso just goes from *${follower--food}$* to *${follower--food-ADV.DER}$* "parasitely".

### Comparative affixes - Augmentative and Diminutive

#### ${AUG}$: "more ... than, -er"

_greater_ **${great-AUG}$**

_prettier, weirder_ **${weird-AUG}$**

#### ${DIM}$: "less ... than"

_less dead_ **${dead-DIM}$**

_less far_ **${far-DIM}$**
