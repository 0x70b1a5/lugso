Capitalization is important! If writing lugso in ALL CAPS, kindly _un_-capitalize your S's and Z's to avoid confusing them with s's and z's.

## Tentacular Abjad

Inverse of normal abjad - vowels are main body of writing; consonants are diacritics.

### Vowels

Vowels form the main body of each word. Words are represented by one connected group of tentacles.

    up-leg: a tentacle sweeping upward.
    down-leg: a tentacle sweeping downward.
    no-leg: a flat tentacle.

### Consonants

Consonants are tentacles that branch off of their root vowels.

A consonant on the left (u/i) or top (o) of its vowel comes prior to the vowel (the _onset_ of the syllable). A consonant on the right (u/i) or bottom (o) of its vowel comes after the vowel (the _coda_ of the syllable).

![consonants on vowels](/assets/buf%20siy%20rog.png)

    1: a plain tentacle branching off the vowel.
    2: a tentacle that splits into two tentacles.
    L: a tentacle terminating in a loop (no trailing tip).
    X': a self-looping tentacle.
    XY: a tentacle composed of an X followed by a Y.

### Examples

The syllables have been hyphenated to assist you in seeing the breakdown.

**lug-so guS-li-ib-so sot-so:**

![lugso guSliibso sotso](/assets/lugso%20guSliibso%20sotso.png)

As you can see, loops in vowels can be ornamental, but loops in consonants are not.

---

Where there are multiple consonants in the onset or the coda of a syllable, they are evaluated left-right, top-bottom.

![tbufl hsiyk zrogs](/assets/tbufl%20hsiyk%20zrogs.png)

This example is nonsense (for now), and a bit cramped, but you can see how on u or i, the top consonant precedes the bottom, and on the o, the left precedes the right.

### Non-ornamental Loops in Vowels

Sometimes lone "o" appears in words, example the name "huoxin" hu+o+xin.

To disambiguate the bare "o", use two loops in the vowel line. below: huoxin vs. huxin.

The small, straight lines here are a shorthand for drafting.
