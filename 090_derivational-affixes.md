### Part-of-speech affixes

Oftentimes you wish to communicate something complex, and you almost have the right word, but not quite - you know _mortal_, but not _mortality_ - you know _death_, but not _deathly_... etc.

The act of turning one word into another part of speech is called _**derivation**_. Hence, "derivational affixes".

In English, _-ity_ turns an ADJ into a N. It's a "nounifier". English also has _-ness_, _-ism_, and so on for this purpose. Meanwhile, _-ly_ turns a N into an ADJ. It's an "adjectifier". See also _-y_, _-ish_, _-ful_...

Lugso has a special suffix for many types of derivation, and several additional affixes for more specific derivations.

#### verb -> noun

Lugso has three noun-ifying ("nominalizing") affixes: one for the _act_ of verbing, one for _the one who verbs_, and one for _the one who is verbed_.

#### non-verb -> noun

For nominalizing a non-verb, use **-lzot** - e.g. _blackness_ **Zkiglzot** (lit. "the act of black").

#### non-adj -> adj

_deathly_ **fhtognfbuyb**.

#### non-adv -> adv

_blackly_ **ZkignSuv**.
