## Relative Clauses

"the X that Yed / the A that B Ced"

**tlu-pol nofor kur...**

`beast-follower possess-REL 1SG`

_the dog that I own..._

In English, "that" does many things, and one of those things is _introduce relative clauses_. A _relative clause_ describes some noun in greater detail.

_the house **that** had ten mice in each room_: "had ten mice..." modifies _house_.

In Lugso, the relative-clause-introducer is another verb suffix. It follows any other suffixes on the verb, for example, future tense:

**hpiS yogso vuntkuor kur...**

`space.3d.or.higher knowledge-GEN penetrate-FUT-REL 1SG`

_the spaces of knowledge that I will penetrate..._

## Conjunctions

"A, **but** B"; "C, **and** D, **and** E"

Note that A, B, C, D, and E are _complete sentences_.

**ZoZ olnriS ffihhgsuSt lihib Zkig, lniin StkiibpzuvZ yols-yols-lihib olnriS.**

`night beautiful rise-SUB.location star-PL black revolve-CONJ.and sky-PL-PROL child-child-star-PL beautiful`

_Strange is the night where black stars rise, and strange moons circle through the skies._
