**tlu-pol nofor kur...**

`beast-follower possess-REL 1SG`

_the dog that I own..._

In English, "that" does many things, and one of those things is _introduce relative clauses_. A _relative clause_ describes some noun in greater detail.

_the house **that** had ten mice in each room_: "had ten mice..." modifies _house_.

In Lugso, the relative-clause-introducer is another verb suffix. It succeeds any other suffixes on the verb, for example, future tense:

**hpiS yogso vuntkuor kur...**

`space.3d.or.higher knowledge-GEN penetrate-FUT-REL 1SG`

_the spaces of knowledge that I will penetrate..._
