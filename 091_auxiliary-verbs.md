An _auxiliary verb_ is like English "can", "might". In English they are effectively intransitive verbs that modify an infinitive. Other intransitives that work similarly are "want", "wish".

In Lugso, to **wish** to do something, you _dream_ for it. To **want** to do something, you _hunger_ for it. Since Lugso is as always head-initial, the structure is [main verb] [auxiliary verb]. (The difference is partly of degree and partly of kind - dreaming is more intellectual and less intense than hungering, which is visceral and strong.)

**fok hhuS ipibir gusSliibluli.**

`harvest hunger head-PL-ACC god-PL-BEN`

_I desire/want/yearn to harvest heads for the gods._

**buz vgov ivihir kur. huf-yu vgov lugir guSliibso sotibso kur.**

`finish can DET.PROX-ACC 1SG. consume knowledge can blood-ACC deity-PL-GEN thought-PL-GEN 1SG.`

_I can do this. I can learn the blood of the thoughts of the gods._

### Questions

**oh** attaches to the auxiliary when forming a question.

**huf-yuiS vgovoh sruZir ivol lugso luk?**

`consume knowledge-CONJ.but can-INT referent-ACC DET.DIST blood-GEN 2SG`

_But can you learn what that blood portends?_
